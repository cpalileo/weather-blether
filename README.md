# weather-blether

I decided to submit this project with several features still missing in order to move forward and focus on the new modules. The weather app features a search function, when a city name is inputted correctly, the current weather conditions are displayed. For the sake of time the 5-day forecast was not included in this version. The recent cities searched shows up in the recent cities list. Although I did start the preliminary work in adding an event listener to the element of the dynamically created line items, when a city name is clicked it does not load the weather report.

Future development:
I plan on completing this assignment in order to make it presentable for my portfolio. Some things I would like to add to future versions are:

- Meet all acceptance criteria of the assignment that was not completed in this version.

- Create a more appealing user interface.
- Incorporate my ideas that are fitting to the app name "Weather Blether"
